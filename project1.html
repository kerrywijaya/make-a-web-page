    April 14th, 2015: How to think like a programmer
    <span class="subheading">I am going to <em>love</em> programming!</span>
  </h1>

  <div class = "content">

    There are five aspects of the way in which programmers think:
    <br>
      <div id="proceduralThinking">
        <b>procedural thinking</b>
        <br>..means giving unambiguous instructions to the computer. <br>It also means approaching the solution of a problem step by step. <br>Procedural thinking is based on..
      </div>
      <div id="techEmpathy">
        <br><b>technolochigal empathy,</b>
        <br>which is basically the assumption that <em>computers are stupid</em> :b
      </div>
      <div id="abstractThinking">
        <br><b>abstract thinking</b>
        <br>..means finding generality amongst things that are seemingly different.
      </div>
      <div id="systemsThinking">
        <br><b>systems thinking</b>
        <br>..is breaking a problem down into smaller pieces, so it's similar to procedural thinking (<em>there - I found a generality!</em>)
      </div>
      <div id="debugging">
        <br><b>debugging</b>
        <br>..is the process of finding and fixing mistakes. You have to ask yourself the following questions:
        <br>- where's the bug?
        <br>- what has caused the bug?
        <br>- how can I fix it?
      </div>
    <p>
      ...now I can't wait to learn more of that stuff!!

    April 16th, 2015: HTML and the world wide web 
    <span class = "subheading"> fundamentals of front end web development</span>
  </h1>

  <div class="content">     
    I would like to become a front end web developer. So what basics do I have to learn?
    <p>a) I have to understand <b>what the world wide web is</b>! 
      <br>The world wide web is an incredible huge collection of text files, images, videos, music and links. 
    </p>
    <p>b) I have to understand <b>how the world wide web works</b>!
       <br>Web browsers make requests to servers. The servers respond with files that are then displayed by the browsers. All the information is transmitted via the internet.
     </p>
    <p>c) I have to understand <b>the significance of HTML</b>!
       <br>HTML can be considered the thread that links all the elements. It is the main type of document on the web.  
    </p>
    <p>d) I have to understand <b>the underlying structure of HTML</b>!
       <br>As a front end developer I have to gain a certain amount of <a href="#techEmpathy">technological empathy</a>. I need this empathy to be able to think of an HTML page as an arrangement of rectangles, or, to put it more figuratively, as a nesting of boxes.
       <br>Every part of an HTML document lies within an invisible box, where smaller boxes are within even smaller ones. The main box that contains all the other ones is the website. A box is created by the div element.
       <br>Here are three examples why this strucutre is so convenient:
      <br>1. You can style the content of a div element with CSS. 
       <br>2. You can create a link within your page that sends you to <a href="#another">another part of the page</a> without loading again.
       <br>3. Repetition of code can lead to mistakes. If you want to do the same thing several times ( make use of a class instead! 
    </p>
    <p>e) If I want to make webpages that <b>look nice</b> I have to know about <b>CSS</b>!
       <br>If HTML is an arrangement of boxes within boxes, CSS is the style (shape, size, color..) of those boxes. Here is an 
       <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-4131369051/m-3626618730">example</a>. You can  change the code and see the results! 
    </p>
     This might become an exciting project :D

    April 17th, 2015: Properties of HTML boxes
    <span class="subheading">Am I still going to love programming?</span>
  </h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      <a href="#april16"><em>Yesterday</em></a> I learned that a web page is like an arrangement of rectangular boxes. 
      <br><em>Today</em> I learned that each box consists of..
      <br>-a margin
      <br>-a border
      <br>-a padding
      <br>-a content
      <br>You can style the elements of your page by changing the size and color of those elements. 
      <br>Click <a href="http://assignments.udacity-extras.appspot.com/courses/html-css/samples/box-model.html">here</a> to see the box model!
    </p>

    <p>HTML and CSS have a <b>tree-like</b> or <b>cascading</b> structure. So, instead of thinking about boxes within boxes, you can actually compare the structure to a tree, its nodes being connected by branches. If you specify certain rules for an element, they will apply to all the other elements that are subordinate to it (i.e. that are <em>growing out of</em> it). 
    <br>You can actually see the tree-like structure if you open the developer-tools of a web page. By clicking on a sideways triangle, you will see all the elements that are included in the element you clicked on. <br>This sounds complicated but once you've tried it out yourself it's quite obvious. 
    <br>Be <em>careful with your code</em>! Because of the cascading structure it is important to make use of indentation when writing HTML code, or you might easily lose control of you work. 
    </p>

    Puh, this is a bit <em>complicated</em>, but I think I'm still going to
    <span class="heart">&hearts;</span> programming :)

    April 20th, 2015: Learning Theory
    <span class="subheading">why this project is so important</span>
  </h1>

  <div class="content flexible">
    <div>
      Some people claim that programming is the most effective way of learning because it includes all the features that are required for a learning process to be successful:
      <p> 
        1) <b>Creativity</b>: As a programmer you don't just read new theory - you apply it <em>immediately</em>. And there is always something new to find out, so your learning process is never going to end. Personally, I find the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp">list of CSS colors</a> really inspiring :D
      </p>
      <p>
        2) <b>Personal motivation</b>: By creating your own web page you apply all the new techniques to something that really affects <b>you</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        3) <b>Immediate feedback</b>: Especially when using tools like <a href="http://www.codepen.io">codepen.io</a>
        developers can see the results of changes on their page immediately. This is an easy and fun way to improve your work until it's perfect!
